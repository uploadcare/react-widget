This is a component made to integrate [Uploadcare Widget][uc-feature-widget]
into your React app easily; convenient props management and lazy loading
are bundled.

The component allows users to upload files from their devices, social media,
cloud storage, and more. All that without any backend code that’s usually
required to handle uploads.

## Install

```
npm i @uploadcare/react-widget
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { Widget } from "@uploadcare/react-widget";

/*
 * Also, you can save 30% in bundle size by using English-only version:
 *
 * import { Widget } from "@uploadcare/react-widget/en";
 */

<Widget publicKey="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" />;
```

* [Basic usage example on CodeSandbox][sandbox-props]
* [Gatsby basic usage example on CodeSandbox][sandbox-gatsby]

To use the component, you should have an **API key** from Uploadcare.

Uploadcare account is free and gives access to serverless file uploads,
transformations, CDN delivery, and APIs. After [sign up][uc-sign-up], you land
on the Dashboard where you manage projects. Projects are identified by their
*public keys*: replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your project’s Public API Key
and you are all set.

You can refer to our [integration guide][react-guide] for more details.

## Configuration

### Component configuration

#### `value: string`

Set a [file UUID][uc-docs-files]/[group UUID][uc-docs-groups] or a [CDN URL][delivery-docs]
as a value.

```jsx
<Widget value='9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1' />
<Widget value='9dd2f080-cc52-442d-aa06-1d9eec7f40d1~12' />
```

<br>

#### `onChange: (fileInfo: FileInfo) => void`

Set a function to be called after **a file is uploaded and ready**.

* [FileInfo object description][api-refs-props]
* [Example][sandbox-on-change]

<br>

#### `onFileSelect: (fileInfo: FileInfo) => void`

Set a function to be called after **a new file is selected**.

* [FileInfo object description][api-refs-props]
* [Example][sandbox-on-file-select]

<br>

#### `customTabs: {[key: string]: CustomTabConstructor}`

Add **custom tabs** for a widget.

```jsx
function myTab(container, button, dialogApi, settings, name, uploadcare) {
  ...
}

<Widget customTabs={{ tabname: myTab }} />
```

Note that we added the fifth argument to the custom tab constructor — an
`uploadcare` object. The widget is lazily-loaded, so you don’t have to import
`uploadcare-widget` separately for your custom tab.

Remember that you have to also include your custom tab in the `tabs` prop to
make it work:

```jsx
<Widget customTabs={{ tabname: myTab }} tabs='tabname' />
```

* [Custom tabs docs][custom-tabs-docs]
* [Example][sandbox-custom-tab]

<br>

#### `validators: Validator[]`

Set **validators** for a widget. Validator is a JavaScript function that
receives a `fileInfo` object for each uploaded file and throws an exception if
that file does not meet validation requirements.

```jsx
const fileTypeLimit = (allowedFileTypes: string) => {
  const types = allowedFileTypes.split(' ')

  return function(fileInfo: FileInfo) {
    if (fileInfo.name === null) {
      return
    }
    const extension = fileInfo.name.split('.').pop()

    if (extension && !types.includes(extension)) {
      throw new Error('fileType')
    }
  }
}

const validators = [fileTypeLimit('mp3 avi mp4')];

<Widget validators={validators} />
```

* [Validator object description][api-refs-validation]
* [FileInfo object description][api-refs-props]
* [Example][sandbox-validators]

<br>

#### `preloader: ComponentType`

Set a custom **preloader**. Preloader is a Component to be shown while a widget
is loading.

<br>

#### `ref: widgetApiRef`

Define a reference object to hold the Widget API wrapper. Use it to access
methods: `openDialog`, `reloadInfo`, and `getInput`.

```jsx
const Example = () => {
 const widgetApi = useRef();
 return (
   <>
     <button onClick={() => widgetApi.current.openDialog()}>
       Click me
     </button>
     <Widget ref={widgetApi} publicKey=“demopublickey” />
   </>
 );
};
```

* [Widget API reference][uc-docs-widget-js-api]
* [Example][sandbox-ref]

<br>

### Widget configuration

Uploadcare Widget can be deeply customized to suit your UX/UI. You can define
allowed upload sources, implement file validation, and more.

All the options defined in the [widget options docs][widget-options-docs] are
also supported in the component as props (use the **camelCase** notation, you
can find it under “Object key” in the referenced article).

Use the live [Uploadcare Widget Configurator][uc-widget-configure] as a starting
point and consider checking out the docs on [widget configuration][uc-docs-widget-config].
